This mini project shows the possible problem that Doctrine has with XML driver when a composite key is used as a foreign key.

Setup:

1. First, setup Doctrine pathes in $doctrineCommonPath, $doctrineDbalPath and $doctrineOrmPath
2. Choose which driver to use: Annotation or XML, configure in $driver

The program will show when you choose XML as driver.
